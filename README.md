# SSH RSA key-pair generation
Generates an SSH RSA key-pair for **educational purposes** only.

Do not use in any serious context. Feel free to open issues or pull requests

## Usage
TODO

**Note**: assumes that you are using Python 3.

## Running Unit Tests
Use `./run-tests` to execute the unit tests (conveniently does
`python -m unittest discover` for you).
